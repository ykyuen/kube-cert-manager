# About this fork

As Let's Encrypt has deprecated ACMEv1, the [kube-cert-manager](https://github.com/PalmStoneGames/kube-cert-manager) no longer works. This repository has the following changes.

- Make ACMEv2 works
- Only for Cloudflare provider
- Replace Glide with Dep

# Kubernetes Certificate Manager

## Deprecation notice: This project is deprecated in favor of [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager)

This project is loosely based on https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kube-cert-manager
It took over most of its documentation, license, as well as the general approach to how things work.

The code itself however, was entirely reimplemented to use xenolf/lego as the basis, instead of reimplementing an ACME client and DNS plugins.

## Version

Please note: This is the documentation for the currently in development version of kcm, please refer to [v0.4.0](https://github.com/PalmStoneGames/kube-cert-manager/tree/v0.4.0) for documentation for the latest stable version

## Special note for upgrading from earlier versions

If you are upgrading from a version before 0.5.0 then note that the default way to identify Ingress resources
to be managed by the certificate manager has changed, from the `enabled` annotation, to the `class` label.
[Backwards compatible behaviour is available](docs/ingress.md) by setting the `-class` [argument](docs/deployment-arguments.md) to a blank value.

## Features

* Manage Kubernetes TLS secrets backed by Let's Encrypt issued certificates.
